## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Any Python IDE or text editor (VS Code configuration included)

### Usage

Each script is self-contained and can be run directly:

```bash
python random_useful_scripts/String_List_Organizer.py
python worst-wordle-score/NYTimesOfficialWordlist.py
```

### Example Usage - String List Organizer

Input:
```python
inputList = ["Test1", "Test2", "Test3", "Test4", "Test5", "Test6", "Test7", "Test8", "Test9", "Test10"]
n = 5  # Number of columns
```

Output:
```
Test1", "Test2", "Test3", "Test4", "Test5"
"Test6", "Test7", "Test8", "Test9", "Test10
```

## Development Environment

This repository includes VS Code configuration with:
- Custom settings for Python development
- Launch configurations for debugging

## Recent Updates
